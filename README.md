# Titanic Survival Prediction üõ≥Ô∏è

A Flask-based machine learning project to predict survival of Titanic passengers using a logistic regression classifier.

## Overview
This project leverages the power of machine learning to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. The web application is built using Flask and serves as a simple interface for users to input the necessary features (such as age, sex, class, etc.) and receive a prediction of whether the passenger survived or not.

## Features
- **Flask Web App UI**: A user-friendly interface to input passenger details and receive a survival prediction.
- **Logistic Regression Classifier**: A logistic regression model trained on historical Titanic data to predict survival.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations for understanding missing data and survival statistics.
- **Preprocessing**: Standard scaling and imputation of missing values before passing data into the model.
- **Model and Preprocessing Saving**: The model and preprocessing steps are saved for reuse in the app.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Python web framework for building the web application.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library used for training and testing the model.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library used for handling Titanic dataset.
- **Numpy**: Numerical computing library used for feature transformation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing EDA results.


## How to Run

1. Install dependencies
First, ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Then, create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
python eda.py(optional)- for visualization of data and cleaning of data
python train_model.py
python run.py


2.Input Data & Get Predictions
Once the app is running, you can:

Enter the passenger information (Pclass, Sex, Age, etc.) into the form.

Click Predict to get the survival prediction result.

The result will be displayed as either "Survived ‚úÖ" or "Did not Survive ‚ùå" based on the prediction made by the model.


#File Descriptions

--train_model.py: Script for training the logistic regression model and saving it for later use.

--run.py: Starts the Flask app.

--app/routes.py: Contains the logic for handling user inputs and making predictions.

--app/templates/index.html: The HTML template for the web interface.

--app/static/style.css: Custom styling for the form.

--data/titanic_data.csv: The dataset used to train the model (Titanic dataset).

-Example of Prediction Input
--Here‚Äôs an example of what a typical input might look like:

-Pclass: 1 (First Class)

-Sex: Female

-Age: 22

-SibSp: 1 (1 sibling/spouse aboard)

-Parch: 0 (No parents/children aboard)

-Fare: 71.2833

-Embarked: C (Cherbourg)

-Prediction Example:
If a passenger with these details is predicted to survive, the message displayed will be:

-<h3>Prediction: Survived ‚úÖ</h3>
If the prediction is that they did not survive:

-<h3>Prediction: Did not Survive ‚ùå</h3>
